## Challenge description

### Basic Recursion

You will be given a positive integer number . Fill in the method sum so that it adds up all the positive integers up to number and returns the sum.
For example, when given 4 it should return 10 (4+3+2+1).

While there are other ways to solve this challenge, you should use recursion to get the sum.

#### Examples

```js
console.log(sum(4))
// => (4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 10

console.log(sum(10))
// => 55
```
